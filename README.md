# üñ•Ô∏è 01 - HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refactor

## Story
As a marketing agency, I wanted a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## üìù Changes made to receive outcome
1. Head amended for easier reading and accessibility 
2. Index.html was broken up into semantic elements with some "div" tags replaced with clearer elements
3. "Header" and "nav" tags added
4. Content specified by using "main" and "article" element
5. "id" added to "search-engine-optimization" to allow header link to navigate down to the article section 
6. Main content class's changed to "link" 
7. Alt Attributes added to all images within html
8. Right column defined into "aside" element 
9. Closing "footer" tag added
10. Style.css cleaned up into sequential order
11. Comments added to style sheet 
12. Excess css that displayed the same outcome were condensed down to 1
